# ABAP
SAP ABAP Objects
These are generic pricing modules that I created in ABAP, to find the given price based on an access sequence.  Since I no longer have access to the SAP platform I have added these objects as PDFs.  These programs are important in that they use pointers for dynamic reads of up to 13 keys in a given table to find the access sequence for the pricing determination.
